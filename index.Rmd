My primary research area is agricultural economics with interests in commodity markets and price analysis. I have established an international reputation for my research that applies granular data to study fundamental societal issues that cause or are consequences of global commodity price movements. Specifically, I have studied the role of climate shocks on commodity price dynamics, and I have examined the relationship between commodity prices and political violence in conflict-prone economies. 

My research has been published in leading field and interdisciplinary journals such as *American Journal of Agricultural Economics*, *Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization*, *Health Economics*, *World Development*, and *Global Environmental Change*, among others. As of `r format(Sys.Date(),'%d %B %Y')`, my research has received `r google_cites` citations as per [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VbNOr6wAAAAJ){target="_blank"}.

For my teaching, I have won the *Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences Teaching Excellence Award* in 2017.

I currently serve as an associate editor of the *American Journal of Agricultural Economics* (from 2022), and as a co-editor of *Food Policy* (from 2018). Previously, I served as an associate editor of the *Australian Journal of Agricultural and Resource Economics* (from 2020 to 2021).
