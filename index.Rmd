I am an applied economist with research interests in food and agricultural markets, climate, and conflict. My current research applies granular data to study fundamental societal issues that lead to or result from social conflict and political violence in developing countries. 

My program of research is funded by the Australian Research Council.

I have published my work in leading field and interdisciplinary journals such as *American Journal of Agricultural Economics*, *Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization*, *Journal of Peace Research*, *World Development*, and *Global Environmental Change*, among others. As of `r format(as.Date(Sys.Date()),'%B %Y')`, my research has received `r google_cites` citations as per [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VbNOr6wAAAAJ){target="_blank"}.

For my research, I have received the *Research Collaboration Award* from the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences in 2024, and the *Quality of Research Discovery Award* from the Australasian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society in 2025.

For my teaching, I have received the *Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences Teaching Excellence Award* in 2017.

I currently serve as an associate editor of the *American Journal of Agricultural Economics* (from 2022), and as a co-editor of *Food Policy* (from 2018). Previously, I served as an associate editor of the *Australian Journal of Agricultural and Resource Economics* (from 2020 to 2021).

I co-organize [Social Conflict and Political Economy (SCoPE)](https://sydneyscope.org/) workshop series.
